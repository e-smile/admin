With e-smile, we wish to see more open, effective and transparent aid systems supporting sustainable and equitable development and engaging citizens not only as beneficiaries, but as actors of their own development.

Concretely, e-Smile is a series of plug-and-play applications combined together to build agile, open, coherent and contextualized information management and monitoring systems.

## Admin Application
The admin module - as the name suggests - allows e-smile global administration. It contains 4 components:
- Administration of installed Apps
- Administration of Monitoring Spaces
- Users and User Groups
- User Rights on available resources

### Administer Applications (Add, remove or update e-smile packages)

e-smile consists of a set of application modules that can be added, upgraded or removed, depending on the actual needs in terms of information management. The Administer Apps component is where this all happens.
